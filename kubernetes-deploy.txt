Run the following command to create the deployments and services in your Kubernetes cluster
kubectl apply -f docker-compose.yml
Verify that the deployments and services were created successfully by running the following command:
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get services
You can access the services by creating a port forward for each service. For example:
kubectl port-forward deployment/flask-microservice 5000:5000
kubectl port-forward deployment/nodejs-microservice 3000:3000
You can now test the micro-services by sending HTTP requests to the localhost on the corresponding port (5000 for Flask and 3000 for Node.js).

When you're done testing, you can stop the port forwarding by pressing CTRL+C.

To delete the deployments and services, run
kubectl delete -f docker-compose.yml
